- Real-time validation and auto-coding
- Monitoring dashboard
- Paradata collection
- Data encryption for security

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StatathonProject.git`

3. Install dependencies: `pip3 install flask pyttsx3 cryptography`
4. Run the app: `python3 app.py`

## Usage
- Access at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/` (or `5000` if using default port)
- Use identifiers (e.g., `123456789012`) for prepopulated surveys
- Interact via chat for multi-modal experience

## Innovation
- Voice-enabled AI avatar for respondent engagement
- Encrypted data handling for privacy
- Potential for patent/research on multi-modal survey systems
